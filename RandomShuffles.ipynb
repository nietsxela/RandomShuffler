    "\n",
    "Quantitative analysis of randomizing a deck of cards has been a topic of research for almost a century.  Efficient shuffling has varying implications ranging from ensuring fairnesss at a casino to information theory.  Early analysis includes Gilber and Shannon \\cite{GS1955}, as well as Reeds (in an unpublished 1981 manuscript).  Later Bayer and Diaconis \\cite{BD92} use rising sequences to describe how a deck is sufficiently randomized after 7 shuffles and Trefethen and Trefethen \\cite{TT2000} TODO. Most of these analyses focus on the common GSR or \"riffle\" shuffle, however there are other practical shuffling techniques and variations that yield different results."

    "#### 1. (GSR) Riffle shuffle and implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "A shuffle is a rearrangement of the elements in an ordered list \\cite{Wolfram}. When describing the possible permutations of a deck of cards the riffle shuffle is one of the most common types of shuffles used to \"randomize\" a deck.  A riffle shuffle occurs when a deck is cut into two, and interleaved back together.  Gilbert and Shannon first formalized this process in a Technical Memo at Bell Labs in 1955 \\cite{GS1955}.  Later Reeds independently formalized the process hence the equivalent name \"GSR\" shuffle.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to implement the riffle shuffle (see \\cite{BD92}), the simplest of which is to cut the deck according to a binomial distribution and then interleave the two decks one card at a time as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    def cut(int: deck_length, ) -> int:\n",
    "        return binom.rvs(deck_length, 0.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def riffle(deck_length: int, cut_location: int) -> list:\n",
    "        i = 0\n",
    "        j = cut_location\n",
    "        output_deck = []\n",

    "            s_x = cut_location - i\n",
    "            s_y = deck_length - j\n",
    "            deck_prob = s_y / (s_x + s_y)\n",
    "            # print(\"s_x: \" + str(s_x) + \" s_y: \" + str(s_y) + \" deck_prob: \" + str(deck_prob))\n",
    "            choice = bernoulli.rvs(deck_prob)\n",
    "            # print(\"Choice: \" + str(choice))\n",
    "            if choice == 0:\n",
    "                output_deck.append(i)\n",
    "                i += 1\n",

    "\n",

A riffle shuffle would therefore be equivalent to a $2$-shuffle. The probability of getting a particular permutaion after an $a$-shuffle whould be given by:\n",

    "See Supplemental Proofs (TODO add link) for additional details on why this is true.  Additionally, an $a$-shuffle followed by a $b$-shuffle (just another $a$-shuffle where $b$ is independent of $a$) is equivalent to an $ab$-shuffle (again, see Supplemental Proofs).  This is significant because it allows us to use an $a^k$-shuffle calculation instead of $k$ different $a$-shuffles in a row.  In the simple riffle shuffle example, shuffling a deck 5 times, would be equivalent to a single $2^5( = 16)$-shuffle."

    "### How to determine the probability of a shuffle determining a random deck\n",
    "\n",
    "In english, we need to find the probability of a given permutation occuring from a given shuffle type, vs occuring from a uniform distribution $U$ (this is because a given permutation being drawn from a shuffle is equivalent to drawing from the probability distribution created by the shuffle).  The uniform density is $\\frac{1}{|S_n|} = \\frac{1}{n!}$ since there are n! different permutations in the deck.  The Riffle Shuffle card distribution after $k$ shuffles will be denoted $R^{(k)}$. In order to determine if a deck is random after k riffle shuffles, we need to determine how large of $k$ makes $||R^{(k)} - U||$ sufficiently small (TODO define sufficiently).  The size of the state space of card permutations is $n!$, far to large to fully enumerate, so we need another way to calculate the probability of a given permuation under a shuffle.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a riffle shuffle, the most common way to determine the probability of a given permutation $\\pi$ under $k$ shuffles is using the concept of rising sequences as defined above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Through a single riffle shuffle, at *most* the amount of rising sequences can double (by splitting the original idenity permutation) where each rising sequence will correspond to the halves of the cut.  The reason why using riffle shuffles improves our ability to determine the probability of $\\pi$ is because in a given deck there are at most $n$ rising sequences (as opposed to $n!$ different permutations).  The probability of achieving a permutation $\\pi$ with $r$ rising sequences after $k$ riffle shuffle is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{{n + 2^k - r} \\choose n}{2^{kn}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is a specific case of the more general form when using the $a$-shuffle described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the variation distance for $\\pi$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|R^{(k)}(\\pi) - U(\\pi)| = \\left| \\frac{{n + 2^k - r} \\choose n}{2^{kn}} - \\frac{1}{n!} \\right| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we must sum this term for all $\\pi$.  This yields\n",
    "\n",
    "$$||R^{(k)} - U|| = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{r=1}^n A_{n,r} \\left| \\frac{{n + 2^k - r} \\choose n}{2^{kn}} - \\frac{1}{n!} \\right| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $A_{n,r}$ (TODO).\n",
    "\n",
    "What we have done is use the proportion of permutations that can occur after $k$ shuffles that contain each number of rising sequences $r$ to provide a probability density over the possible permutations after $k$ shuffles.  This then allows us to cleanly take the variations distance without needing to enumerate the individual probabilities of getting each of the $n!$ permutations after $k$ shuffles.  We take advantage of the fact that many permutations with certain numbers of rising sequences have calculatable probabilities after $k$ shuffles (while many are not possible at all).\n",
